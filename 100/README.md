# 100 - Introduction

As part of one of the John Wooden's "Pyramid of Success" building blocks - the **Condition** - we here introduce the "The Twelve Foundations for a Good Life" by Scott H. Young that are addressed as part of this building block.

The intention is that one or more of these Twelve Foundations for a Good Life are *actioned* whilst conducting the activity of **Condition**, which is daily during the week.
