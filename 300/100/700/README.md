Sleep fills out the trifecta of health-oriented foundations, following fitness and diet. While seemingly the simplest of the three, it’s tricky to get right.

As a parent with two small kids, I can attest to the difficulty (and importance) of getting adequate sleep, particularly in the newborn phase when waking up multiple times a night is a part of the package.

But sleep is more than just unconsciousness. The rhythms for your falling asleep and waking up define your day, determine your energy and dictate what sorts of activities you’ll be able to excel at. There’s a reason entire books have been devoted to the topic of waking up early—a change in sleep rhythms can be transformative for the rest of your life.
