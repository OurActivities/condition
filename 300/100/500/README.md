Few practices are as important for bringing high-quality ideas into your life as reading more books. This foundation has [weakened for the average American](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx) — the number of books read has declined precipitously since the invention of smartphones and social media.

While blogs and courses can teach you things, there’s something special about books. To write a book, the author has to spend at least a few *years* thinking deeply about a topic. Reading a good book gives you the concentrated output of years of thinking from a smart person on a topic. The same probably can’t be said for the average Instagram story.

We all know we should read more, but we don’t always have the foundation in place for doing so.
