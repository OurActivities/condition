If regular reading shapes the flow of information into your head, regular writing shapes the ideas that are already there. Journaling, whether documenting events, planning for the future or trouble-shooting life’s many problems, is a foundation for more thoughtful, deliberate decisions.

Reflection is a foundation that, for many of us, ends up in disrepair because of the urgency of many of the typical tasks we face. We’re so busy that we don’t have time to sit down and think about our goals, problems and motivations. But this frenetic pace encourages us to be impulsive in our decision-making, rather than thoughtful. It can exacerbate the frazzled busyness that made us forego contemplation in the first place!
