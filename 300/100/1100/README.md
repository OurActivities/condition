# 1100 - Organization

> **Keystone Habit**: Initially, reorganize one small space per day (could be a drawer, shelf or computer folder). Later, ensure that everything has a home (so the organization system is sustainable).

 Organizing our tasks is central to productivity—if we keep misplacing tasks and appointments, we won’t be very effective.

A parallel exists in our physical environment. If our physical space is cluttered and disorganized, we have a hard time making use of our stuff.

Getting organized, however, is daunting. There’s a large fixed cost to decluttering, which can mean we live with the mess rather than fix it. Poor organizational systems tend to revert to chaos relatively quickly if they don’t serve the functions of our lives.
