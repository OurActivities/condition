After fitness, healthy eating is probably the best investment you can make in your body. Yet eating right can be really challenging.

For starters, our brains evolved to overconsume. We live in an environment with an abundance of calories, but our instincts are geared toward the threat of future starvation.

Second, nutritional advice is confusing. Should you eat low-fat or low-carb? Is butter good for you? Eggs? Yet despite the seeming flip-flopping of nutritional science,2 the core of healthy eating is fairly obvious—we just don’t do it all the time.

Finally, diet is hard because it isn’t one habit but many. It’s a decision about what breakfast to eat, whether to snack at work and how much to indulge while staying with family over the holidays. Each decision a complex trade-off between health, enjoyment and social obligations.
