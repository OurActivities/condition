In a recent conversation Scott H. Young had with Cal Newport, he brought up the importance of being seen as a reliable, productive person — not someone who works furiously to complete tasks, simply someone who doesn’t drop the ball.

Productivity, and the reputation that goes with it, is a foundation that allows you to (somewhat paradoxically) push back against a culture of burnout and overwork. If everyone knows you’re organized with your time and to-do list, and you say you don’t have space for more work, they’ll believe you. If they think you’re scattered or lazy, they might assume they can get more from you just by squeezing harder.

Aside from grand achievements or not mindlessly working extra hours, this is why a foundation in basic productivity systems is so important. If you have your act together, you’ll be much more able to work in ways that make sense for you.
