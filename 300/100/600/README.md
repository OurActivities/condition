> **Keystone Habit**: Once per week, engage in an activity that allows you to meet new people.

Our quality of life depends on the quality of our relationships. You can have a perfect body and tons of money but be miserable if the human connections in your life are lacking or absent.

I think of relationships with people as two separate foundations: outreach and connection. Outreach is meeting new people and reconnecting with people you already know but donâ€™t see often. Broadening your social network gives you new opportunities to make friends, get to know colleagues or find romantic partners.
