All the foundations I’ve listed so far are largely self-centered. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing. Having your life together is probably the most important precursor to living altruistically. If we neglect our financial foundations, we can become the friend who’s always broke and needs to borrow money. If we neglect our productivity foundations, we can become so frazzled at work that we can’t contribute. If we neglect the foundations of our relationships and interests, we can find ourselves stuck at home because of years of inactivity. Neglecting foundations tends to make us less able to help others and more dependent on others for help.

But a purely self-centered attempt at securing greater foundations is self-defeating. Ultimately, we’re not just living to maximize our own self-interest; we’re working to make life better for the people around us. Service is the foundation for a meaningful life.
