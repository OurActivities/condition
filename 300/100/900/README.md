I’ll never forget the advice an older friend gave me upon hearing that I was about to become a father: “Don’t listen to people who say they spend ‘quality time’ with their kids. When it comes to your kids, quantity time is quality time.”

Our key relationships, with our family, partners, and best friends are obviously important. Often, we fail to shore up this foundation regularly. We chase far-off ambitions while neglecting the nearby relationships that underpin our happiness. 

Phones and digital distractions have made this worse. We can now be physically in the same room with others, yet utterly disconnected.
