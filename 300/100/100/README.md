Fitness is a paradigmatic example of a foundation. While not everyone needs to be an Olympian, we all benefit from being in shape. Being in shape comes with an enormous list of benefits to health, mood, longevity and even cognition. 

But being in shape is not something you can “bank” through an intensive project and not worry about later. You need to maintain good habits and attitudes to ensure you’re getting enough physical activity by default — even when you’re not “trying to get in shape.”
